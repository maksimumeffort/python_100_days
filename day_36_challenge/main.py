#
# print(diff_percent)
# print(0.0128 * yesterday_close)
# When STOCK price increase/decreases by 5% between yesterday and the day before yesterday then print("Get News").
#HINT 1: Get the closing price for yesterday and the day before yesterday. Find the positive difference between the two prices. e.g. 40 - 20 = -20, but the positive difference is 20.
#HINT 2: Work out the value of 5% of yerstday's closing stock price.

    # Instead of printing ("Get News"), actually fetch the first 3 articles for the COMPANY_NAME.

    ## STEP 3: Use twilio.com/docs/sms/quickstart/python
    # Send a separate message with each article's title and description to your phone number.
    #HINT 1: Consider using a List Comprehension.
